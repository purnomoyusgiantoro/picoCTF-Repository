# Information

## Overview :

* Unminify

## Description :

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster! Browse here, and find the flag!

## Hints :

1. Try CTRL+U / âŒ˜+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl <URL> in your shell.

2. Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
   
3. What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

## Approach :

1. The first thing you have to do is open the page source and look for the flag
2. If you have difficulty, you can use Beuty Code online to tidy up the code
